### An opportunity to divert my career path for something I desire

27 March 2023: This is the day in which I Googled game development seriously, found the book mentioned in the abstract and started to read it. The first thing I did was to go over the contents. I first skimmed through the main titles and then the first level subtitles.

Here, I will share the notes I took today. I will update my notes over time.
